SAMPLE PRODUCT IMAGES - README
================================================================================

This template includes 3 sample SVG product images as examples:

1. sample-1.svg - Wireless Headphones (Purple gradient)
2. sample-2.svg - Smart Watch (Blue gradient)  
3. sample-3.svg - Laptop Backpack (Green gradient)

LOCATION: assets/images/products/

================================================================================
IMPORTANT FOR PRODUCTION USE
================================================================================

These are DEMO images only. For production use or marketplace submission:

1. REPLACE with actual product photos (JPG/PNG format recommended)
2. Use high-quality images (800x800px to 1200x1200px)
3. Optimize images for web (keep under 500KB each)
4. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., wireless-headphones.jpg)

See IMAGE-GUIDELINES.md for complete instructions.

================================================================================
CURRENT SETUP
================================================================================

The template is configured to use these sample images by default. Products
will display these SVG placeholders until you replace them with your own
product photos.

To replace images:
1. Add your product images to: assets/images/products/
2. Update image paths in: assets/js/products.js and assets/js/home.js
3. Change from: "assets/images/products/sample-1.svg"
   To: "assets/images/products/your-product-image.jpg"

================================================================================
FOR THEMEFOREST/ENVATO SELLERS
================================================================================

When submitting to marketplaces:

✓ Include these sample images to show buyers the structure
✓ Clearly document that buyers must replace with their own images
✓ Provide detailed instructions (see IMAGE-GUIDELINES.md)
✓ Consider including 2-3 optimized real product photos as examples
